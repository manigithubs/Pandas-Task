30.#Consider a DataFrame containing rows and columns of purely numerical data. Create a list of the row-column index locations of the 3 largest values.

df.unstack().sort_values()[-3:].index.tolist()

38.#Some values in the the FlightNumber column are missing. These numbers are meant to increase by 10 with each row so 10055 and 10075 need to be put in place. Fill in these missing numbers and make the column an integer column (instead of a float column).

43. #In the RecentDelays column, the values have been entered into the DataFrame as a list. We would like each first value in its own column, each second value in its own column, and so on. If there isn't an Nth value, the value should be NaN.

A candlestick chart shows the opening, closing, highest, and lowest price for a stock during a time window.  The color of the "candle" (the thick part of the bar) is green if the stock closed above its opening price, or red if below.

![Candlestick Example](img/candle.jpg)

This was initially designed to be a pandas plotting challenge, but it just so happens that this type of plot is just not feasible using pandas' methods.  If you are unfamiliar with matplotlib, we have provided a function that will plot the chart for you so long as you can use pandas to get the data into the correct format.

Your first step should be to get the data in the correct format using pandas' time-series grouping function.  We would like each candle to represent an hour's worth of data.  You can write your own aggregation function which returns the open/high/low/close, but pandas has a built-in which also does this.
